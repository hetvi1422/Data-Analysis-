## 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis Project

---

## 📝 Overview
🔹 This project focuses on **preprocessing and analyzing the Titanic dataset**.  
🔹 Main goals: handle **missing values** and **address class imbalance** to prepare the dataset for machine learning.  
🔹 Dataset (`train_test2.csv`) contains passenger information: Age, Sex, Class, Fare, and Survival Status.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
⚡ Identify and handle missing values in important features  
⚡ Analyze and fix class imbalance in the target variable (Survived)  
⚡ Prepare a clean and balanced dataset ready for modeling
