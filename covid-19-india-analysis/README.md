# 🦠 COVID-19 India Data Analysis

---

## 📌 Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the COVID-19 India dataset to understand the **spread, impact, and recovery trends** across different Indian states and over time.  
The analysis focuses on **state-wise** and **time-based patterns** using Python data analysis libraries.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset Name:** COVID-19 in India  
- **Link:** [COVID-19 in India Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india)  

The dataset contains **daily records of confirmed, recovered, and death cases** across Indian states.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding environment

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
The following steps were performed to **clean and prepare the data**:

- Converted the `date` column into a proper **datetime format**  
- Extracted **Day, Month, and Year** from the date column  
- Removed **unnecessary columns**  
- Handled **grouped and aggregated values** for analysis

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
The project includes the following key analyses:

- 🏴 **State-wise total confirmed COVID-19 cases**  
- ⚠️ **Identification of the most affected state**  
- 🟢 **Identification of the least affected states**  
- 📅 **Month-wise trend of COVID-19 cases**  
- 📈 **Worst month based on total confirmed cases**  
- 💉 **First wave vs second wave comparison**  
- 🔴 **Active cases analysis**  
- ☠️ **Death rate analysis by state**  
- 💚 **Recovery rate analysis by state**  
- ⚖️ **Recovery vs Death comparison (visualized)**

## 📈 Key Insights
- 🏆 **Maharashtra** was the most affected state with the highest number of confirmed cases  
- 📊 COVID-19 cases showed **clear monthly waves**, indicating peak periods  
- 🔹 A small number of states contributed the **majority of total cases**  
- 💚 Recovery cases were consistently **higher than death cases** across most states  
- ⚠️ Active case analysis highlighted **periods of maximum healthcare burden**  

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
This analysis shows that COVID-19 had an **uneven impact across Indian states**, with clear variations over time.  
Despite high infection rates during peak periods, **recovery trends remained strong** compared to mortality.  
The project demonstrates how **effective data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization** can help derive meaningful insights from real-world public health data.
